# onebusaway_api_client_demo_app

This is the OneBusAway Client API demo app for testing the API Client library made with Dart.

## Getting Started

Make sure you clone the library's repository first from [here](https://github.com/eyad-hussein/onebusaway_api_client_library).

Then, clone the `onebusaway_api_client_demo_app` repository.

After cloning the app's repository, ensure that you set the path of the `onebusaway_api_client_library` in the `pubspec.yaml` file to the same path you cloned the `onebusaway_api_client_library` to.

```yaml
dependencies:
  onebusaway_api_client_library:
    path: /path_to_onebusaway_api_client_library
```

Next,

```bash
cd path_to_onebusaway_api_client_demo_app
```

Then,

```bash
flutter run
```
